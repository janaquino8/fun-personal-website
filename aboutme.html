                Jan Leoric Badiola Aquino is an CS student, currently taking up a BS Computer Science Major in Software Technology program at De La Salle University. A 2nd year student, he has partaken in numerous coding and non-coding projects, from web applications and learning models to events and seminars.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was born on September 14, 2005 at Pasay City to two graduates of BSCS, although only one of them stayed in the industry. As for Jan, it wasn't until grade 9 when he discovered the career path he thought would benefit him: game development. Through his former interest in Call of Duty: Mobile, he initially made it his mission to provide a surreal gaming experience for players alike, free from bugs.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, he realized two things:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The game dev industry in the Philippines is relatively limited.</li>
                <li>CODM was all he ever played. No AAA games or anything in between.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                It was fine. He definitely would've benefitted more from software development anyway. Speaking of which, he would land in DLSU as early as Senior High School. From there, he got to discover the vast STEM field, getting him ready for what was in-store for him in his undergraduate, all while making a few but meaningful connections with peers, giving him new insights and perspectives on a lot of stuff. In the end, he managed to become a Silver Merit Awardee thanks to his efforts througout the 2 year period.
            </p>
            <p>
                SHS was just the tip of the iceberg though. Although he hasn't been there for long, he is having too much fun in his time as an undergraduate. He got to make significantly more connections, challenge himself with extra-curriculars, take on leadership roles, and learn new stuff each and every day from some of the best professors in the field. The best part? He continues to maintain his consistency as as 1st Dean's Lister. Despite the challenges, he continues to thrive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Academics aside, he partakes in gaming, casually but seriously. He recently got a new gaming laptop (Asus TUF Gaming A16); finally he's no longer stuck with just Roblox. He finally got to try out games such as Fortnite and Warzone, as well as reconnect with Rocket League, which was a core memory for him during the pandemic. <i>May I add though, <b>Warzone my beloved damn bro I still can't believe I get to play Warzone now, and at 120 FPS too!</b></i> 
            </p>
            <p>
                He's also into the arcade scene, specifically he goes to his nearest Timezone to play the hit games, Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune, Pump It Up, and Maimai DX. <i>May I add as well I may be coming off with an addiction, and pls I want to stop this I needa lock in.</i> For shenanigans outside of those, he's also into logic puzzles such as sudoku and minesweeper. <i><b>Bro I'm also addicted rn into minesweeper pls make it STOP</b></i>
            </p>
            <p>
                That's all from him for now. He thanks you for reading!
